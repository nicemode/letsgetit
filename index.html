    <p>While I have never visited Serengeti National Park, it is one of the place that I would like to explore so I can see how animals migrate and get a chance to see the big five; Lions, Leopard, Buffalo, African elephant, and Rhinoceros. </p>

    <h1>Arches National Park</h1>

    <p>Arches National Park, located near Moab, Utah, is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the U.S.. It is well-known for its eponymous stone arches, some of which measure hundreds of feet long.
      Historically, it was inhabited by the Ute and Paiute tribes, and petroglyphs can still be found in the area along some of the arches.</p>
